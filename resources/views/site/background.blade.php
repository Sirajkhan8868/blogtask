                    There are 9 cycles of incarnation during which our soul evolves! Your soul is a “seed”; or “a part of
                    light” of the 72 creative angels. You come from one and the same creative Angel that you can find
                    according to your day of birth. You always incarnate at the same time, within a range of 4 days, which
                    corresponds to your creative Angel. To change the cycle our soul must have passed its tests and evolved.
                    She can spend hundreds of lives in the same cycle (except cycle 1 where there is only one incarnation)
                    as long as she has not transcended each ordeal according to the cycle. Each cycle has its specificity
                    and makes us work on a specific theme. Below you will find the specificity of each cycle</p>

                <p class="fs-6 pt-4">
                    Once cycle 9 is completed, our soul has reached angelic status. She can then decide to stay “up” and
                    become a guide for other incarnated souls or to return, one last time, to incarnate on earth, to help
                    other humans. She is incarnated as an earthly angel and no longer has a life path between 1 and 9. This
                    is why certain people have Master Numbers 11, 22 or 33 as their life path (or even in very rare case 44
                    or 55). It is then said that these people are reincarnated in Master vibration. If by calculating your
                    life path you land directly on 11,22,33...you are master and therefore you cannot be either Walk'in or
                    metanova</p>
                <p class="text-start fs-6">Master 11 = angelic vibration = Guidance<br>
                    Master 22 = archangelic vibration = Builder<br>
                    Master 33 = Christic vibration = Teacher</p>
                <p class="text-start fs-5">The Walk’ins and the Metanovas are also Master vibrations but hidden! When you
                    calculate your life path you fall between 1 and 9 but you <br>know deep down that you are different...
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-start pt-4">Walk’ins:
                </h3>
                <p class="text-start fs-6 pt-4">This is the first wave of Volunteers. This only concerns people born before
                    the 1970s. These are people
                    who have suffered a serious trauma, great depression, illness, may be born prematurely, having had a
                    NDE. ( near-death experience)…. and the part of their angel came to replace them by embodying their body
                    and the soul returns. It is not a possession because it is not an external or different being, it is our
                    angel from which our soul comes. Walk’ins can happen at any age. When the Walk'in manifests itself, it
                    can be very difficult for the person concerned because they suddenly become a Master vibration and can
                    take time to feel the impact and adapt to their new "high vibrations". On the other hand, the person who
                    has undergone a walk’in can develop a “gift” such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, mediumship, etc.


                    In the film “Charlie’s Secret” you have a great example of Walk’in. Charlie has a near-death experience.
                    Following this, he becomes clairaudient, clairvoyant and clairsentient.</p>
                <h3 class="text-start mt-4">The Metanovas or Volunteers:
                </h3>
                <p class="mt-4 fs-6 text-start pb-4">Indigo soul, crystal, rainbow, diamond. These are new souls who incarnate with new bodies of light which
                    allow them to have higher vibrations during incarnation. These “new souls” (new breed of human) appeared
                    from the 1970s and are all missionary. They have great angelic protection. The “reset” during their
                    reincarnation is not complete to be able to transmit information during their life and many remember
                    their previous life until the age of 4 or 5 years old. Then they behave like everyone else for a long
                    phase of their life, then When they reach a certain maturity around 30 or 40 years old, they have a
                    masterful awakening phase. These people are untouchable on the karmic and etheric levels. If they die
                    before being able to carry out their mission, they are reincarnated immediately. Metanovas can only be
                    born if at least one of the parents is born a master or walk'in. So to know if you are metanova your
                    father or mother must have been born a master or have done a walk'in before your birth. Metanovas
                    represent approximately 1% of the population!</p>
