                    <p class="fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">From a young age, I realized that I was a special person.<br> Someone we could
                        call ''Special''. Sometimes I
                        saw people<br> who weren't actually there or simply felt presences without<br> really knowing why.

                        During my adolescence a lot of these acuities developed, I<br> could communicate with people who
                        were not
                        there <br> simply through candles, or sometimes with friends we<br> played Ouija (which is strongly
                        discouraged).
                        And each <br> time very intense things happened.

                        The more the years passed, the more I closed in on myself, not <br> understanding what was so
                        different about
                        me.. Was I broken? <br> I crazy? Why can't I do like the others? Why do I feel the need to <br> do
                        everything
                        differently? I asked myself many questions which <br> went unanswered for a long time.

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-3">3 years ago, I had an indiscident who threw me to the other side.<br> Without
                        really knowing why, during a
                        hike with friends, my heart <br> stopped beating. The emergency services having tried to resuscitate
                        <br> me
                        confirmed that they had failed. I was dead for 3 min 45 sec for <br> no apparent medical reason.
                        Subsequently, without warning, I woke <br> up frightened and screaming at the top of my lungs.</p>

                        details that I cannot
                        ignore, it<br> was a full moon night, on a hill that is said to be haunted<br> and the last hour on
                        the clock
                        before my friends realized<br> my condition was 3:33</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-3">In the upper echelons one would say that it was a call for<br> my awakening. To the
                        average person it would
                        seem like it<br> was just some sort of heart problem. However, even today,<br> my health is doing
                        wonderfully.
