                <h1>What is awakening? : many wonder about this</h1>
                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">I'm going to talk to you a little bit about what awakening is, or what it isn't.<br>
                    Many people wonder about this (rightly or wrongly), and struggle to find even the beginnings of an
                    answer.<br>
                    First of all, awakening is not enlightenment. These are two different things.
                    What is awakening?</p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">Awakening is a different state of consciousness, close to that of a very young child,
                    which offers a
                    fresh and complete look at the <br> world. Describing it is a challenge, because it goes beyond
                    intellectual understanding, and defining it with words is therefore<br> impossible. Words mislead,
                    rather than guide, when they attempt to reveal to us something beyond understanding. We could say <br>
                    that awakening is a state in which we are connected to everything, we feel everything, and we know that
                    we are part of this <br> whole... without conceiving it intellectually.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">Paradoxical, isn't it? In fact, we could talk about<br>
                    “true knowledge”. In life, we know nothing. Human beings are born and die without truly knowing
                    anything. But in awakening, the <br> part of us that knows is there, it communicates with us, and we
                    know… truly.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    Awakening is not something constant, nor acquired. You can achieve enlightenment, and lose it in the
                    next minute. You can be <br> awake for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years, and
                    suddenly no longer be awake. It's a bit like joy, we <br> experience it randomly, one moment we're
                    happy, and
                    the next we're not. We can't really control that, but we can offer ourselves <br> a living environment
                    that
                    promotes the appearance of joy. The same goes for awakening. A<br>
                    spiritual and serene life, close to nature, is more inclined to trigger a state of awakening in us.

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    How to achieve enlightenment? Starting by giving up your search! Indeed, he <br> who seeks enlightenment
                    only
                    finds it when he gives up. in Taoism, we speak of Wu Wei, or Non-Action.<br>
                    It is an approach that aims to stop trying to do a thing, to allow that thing to be done. Wu Wei
                    consists of following the Natural <br> course, without trying to fight against it. He who fights against
                    the
                    current drowns, while he who lets himself be carried away <br> suffers <br>
                    the shore.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    A Native American saying goes “Don’t fight against the torrent, let<br>
                    you flow with him.” In Chan, and Zen Buddhism, meditation is practiced without object or motive. This is
                    the reason why many <br> currents practice it facing the wall. We don't meditate to achieve awakening or
                    enlightenment, we meditate, that's all. <br>
                    He who meditates to achieve enlightenment completely misses the goal.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    Anyone who looks at the top of the mountain when he begins to climb it runs out of breath from the first
                    steps, and sees nothing <br> of the landscape, nor of the rock in which he will trip his feet. While the
                    one
                    who looks at the path he is on, and what surrounds <br> him, without trying to know where he is going,
                    he
                    enjoys the landscape, avoids pitfalls, and really goes somewhere. For those who <br> would like to have
                    already arrived, the path seems too long, for those who take advantage of the path, it seems very
                    short.<br>

                    This is one of the meanings of “Here and Now” in Buddhism. Consciousness must be where we are,<br> and
                    at
                    the moment we are there.

                </p>


                <h1 class="fs-1 mt-4">
                    A Zen tale offers us a superb metaphor <br> on this subject. In Japanese, awakening is <br> called
                    “Satori”.
                </h1>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    One day, a lumberjack heard about a rare and legendary animal called Satori. All the hunters said that
                    whoever caught one, alive <br> or dead, would be a true hero. Our woodcutter wanted to know more, and
                    asked
                    “where do we find such an animal?” He was told <br> that it was found everywhere, but that it was so
                    difficult to see and catch that it was a wasted effort. Returning to his forest to cut <br> wood, he
                    couldn't
                    get Satori out of his head, he wanted at all costs to see this animal, and catch it.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">Determined, he began to search the woods, discreetly, to find a trace of Satori. Every day he spent
                    considerable time searching <br> for her, but in vain.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    One day, however, he heard a little mocking laugh in the foliage, and a mischievous voice said to him:
                    “You must be crazy or naive <br>if you think you will one day catch me!” The woodcutter immediately
                    recognized Satori, and decided to redouble his efforts... but <br> nothing worked. He built traps, he
                    tried to make noise to frighten Satori and push him into making a mistake in his haste, he <br> instead
                    tried to hide for hours, scanning the undergrowth.

                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    Nothing to do, not only did he not see Satori, but the latter had taken to making fun of the
                    woodcutter:<br>
                    “Did you really think such a rudimentary trap would be enough to catch me?”
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    As time passed, the woodcutter despaired. But what worried him most was that he had abandoned his work,
                    and that the cold <br> days would soon arrive. He was then forced to resolve to cut wood again, but
                    Satori
                    harassed him, making his work difficult.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    Every time he tried to work, Satori would tell him:<br>

                    “Come on, aren’t you going to look for me today? Maybe this time will be the right one!”<br>

                    Our lumberjack had no choice, if he wanted to have enough to heat himself, and enough to give the <br>
                    village wood for the fireplaces, he had to concentrate.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">

                    He tried to absorb himself in his work, to stop listening<br>
                    Satori.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    At first he couldn't do it, the nasal and mocking voice irritated him, but eventually he got used to
                    Satori's taunts, and didn't mind.<br>
                    paid more attention. So much so that he couldn't even tell if Satori had made fun of him for 5 minutes,
                    or
                    the whole day!<br>
                    He cut down a tree, still concentrating on his work, and as it fell to the ground, a high-pitched squeal
                    was
                    heard.<br>
                    The woodcutter, worried, went to see where it came from, and he found something stuck under the tree. He
                    moved the trunk, and <br> was struck with amazement: it was Satori!
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">In general, we have all experienced enlightenment at least once.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">As children, we were close to this state. Sometimes, when we are absorbed by our work, or by one of our
                    actions, when we are just <br> present, and conscious, a few seconds of awakening come to enlighten us.
                    When
                    it’s
                    so short, it’s hard to realize that something <br> has happened. We felt “strange”, we<br>
                    the impression of having felt dizzy, or that for a moment one was like the spectator of life, and even
                    the
                    spectator of oneself.<br>

                    As if we were watching all this from “further away”. We tell ourselves that we didn't get enough sleep,
                    and
                    we forget. However,<br> this was perhaps a fragment of awakening that was offered to us</p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Achieving awakening means being present here, and now, being aware, being in what we are doing.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    It is not seeking awakening. It is doing, not seeking to<br>
                    TO DO. It’s living a healthy life, eating healthy food. Achieving enlightenment can be done by anyone,
                    in
                    any situation. In good<br> health or sick, full or hungry, fit or tired, in meditation or at work, in
                    full
                    effort or at rest, in nature or in prison... but a life more<br> serene, calmer, more calm, healthier,
                    and
                    more
                    natural, promotes the emergence of awakening, which then tends to manifest <br> spontaneously, more
                    often,
                    and
                    for longer.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    The frequency, intensity, and duration of wakefulness could almost be a “measuring device”, an indicator
                    of
                    the quality of our life.<br> There is nothing surprising in the fact that monks cultivating their land,
                    eating
                    good healthy products, close to nature and serene <br> were able to speak about notions like awakening
                    with
                    more
                    eloquence than anyone else. <br>
                    else. Their living conditions favored this experience.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    Awakening allows us to see more things, to understand things, inside ourselves, without the intellect,
                    without thinking. It allows us <br> to memorize what we see, to fix it in our soul, in our mind, like a
                    pure
                    crystal. These memories are then, once waking is gone, like <br> those of a distant dream. We have the
                    impression
                    that these memories are unreal, but paradoxically, they are of extraordinary <br> clarity and precision.
                    Sometimes we come to have the impression that these are someone else's memories that have been <br>
                    communicated
                    to us.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
                    This is because these memories belong to a part of us which is beyond our ordinary consciousness. These
                    are
                    the memories of a <br> part of our being closer to what is divine.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5">
                    What is awakening? It is the state of being that is healthy.

                    It is the child who learns a language to perfection in just a few months. It’s the spark in this child’s
                    eyes when he sees a tree, or an <br> animal. It is the Sakki of the warrior (a sort of unintelligible
                    intuition
                    which allows us to avoid an aggression, and to only become <br> aware of it, at best, after the fact).

                <p class="fs-5">Awakening is the opening of oneself to oneself.

                    Awakening is the adult sleeping while the child observes the<br>

                <p class="fs-5">It is the reflection of the moon on a sea of oil.
