                <p class="fs-6 mt-4 pb-3 text-start ">We live in a hypothesis of Time and Space. We are constantly moving from one world
                    to another. We can, via our consciousness, change the Time line or the universe. With each of our
                    decisions or each time we modify our state of consciousness, we change the World (parallel universe). It
                    is reality!
                </p>
                <p class="fs-6 pt-4 text-start">

                    Each of our thoughts takes us to another world and the number of worlds is infinite. This is why the
                    higher planes await a revolution of consciousness on our part. If we want the world » is improving” or »
                    change » it is up to us to slide from one world to another to reach this ideal world. It’s difficult to
                    imagine but it’s our choice. It’s even a personal choice!</p>
                <p class="fs-6 pt-4 pb-5 text-start">There are also some time travelers who move from one world to another with notable
                    differences. It’s because they jumped too quickly! For example, they may find themselves in a similar
                    world but their neighbor is not the same. It’s a shift in energy, a shift in consciousness like a
                    too-rapid leap of consciousness. It’s like an “accident of conscience”. In the world, there are 8 to 10
                    people who have made this leap of consciousness. Most of the time, it escalates and as a result we don't
                    feel aware of it.
