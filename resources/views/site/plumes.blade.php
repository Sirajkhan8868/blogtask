                    If you ask them for a sign, you just need to pay a little attention to those around you the following
                    days. Also you will always know, if it is intended for you,<br> by a recognition of the heart! And
                    sometimes
                    you'll even know who put it in your path. In the past, you will be able to find it, during difficult
                    times in your life,<br> as inexorable support</p>
                <p class="fs-6 pt-4 pb-5">You can then collect them and keep them, or like me take a photo of them, to keep a
                    wonderful memory.
