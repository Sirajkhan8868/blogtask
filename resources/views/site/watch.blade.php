                <p class="fs-6 mt-4 pb-3">The famous mirror hours! These are series of the same digit, or of two digits which repeat as11:11 a.m.;
                    3:33; 7:19 p.m. etc.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-6">It is common to hear people say » Wow! I have mirror hours” or “for several days, I have had 10:22 p.m.”
                    but without understanding, or searching, that there is a message behind. I have argued with people
                    several times, even getting kicked out of a Facebook group after only explaining that seeing mirror
                    hours was of no use if we didn't take into account the message they were giving. delivered. To me it's
                    like being given a car and leaving it in the garage just looking at it not knowing that you can drive
                    it. You can say you have a nice car but if it just sits there looking pretty, it won't be of any use to
                    you. And any motorist will urge you to to drive it and get your license to really enjoy it. And this is
                    where I end my analogy….to understand numbers, you need to know what their energy represents.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">It is important to understand that numbers are a language of the Universe that he uses every day in his
                    creations. This is how we find the golden ratio φ everywhere in plants, faces, the human body…. It is
                    your soul which connects directly to the universe and which, by law of attraction, shows you the numbers
                    (messages) that you need at the moment M to inform you and tell you where you should be; confirm to you
                    if you are doing well, or that you are on the right path but also if you are vibrating badly, or that
                    you have not listened to the advice.

                    Mirror hours are for “beginners” in the sense that it is the easiest to spot for the untrained human
                    eye! Once we understand this, we are more attentive to the numbers that are found absolutely everywhere
                    around us, such as on number plates, advertisements, receipts, etc. AND so many other things. Once you
                    are around the mirror hours, you will notice the repetition of 3-digit numbers which are also messages
                    from the universe. </p>
                <p class="fs-6">The only caveat is ego! And yes, our dear ego, which tells us every time that it’s nonsense, that it’s
                    our mind playing tricks on us or that it’s just chance! If you see a number repeatedly, it's a message
                    from the universe. It's up to you to read this message, to understand it (because some make us question
                    ourselves (work on our ego)), and to manifest it!</p>
                <p class="fs-6">On the other hand, when some of you see different mirror hours in the same day (like 11:11; 1:13:13; 8:20
                    p.m.….) and every time you look at the time you fall over a double hour and for several weeks or even
                    months, it is then an expansion of consciousness. Your higher consciousness tells you, through the
                    numbers in the matrix, that everything is just theater here on earth, and invites you to continue to
                    “break down the walls.” or “lift the veil” of the matrix. On the other hand, it also tells you thatyou
                    increase your vibration rate.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">The Number 1:
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">On a spiritual level, 1 symbolizes a pillar of light; it is the “inner self” with divine characteristics.
                    It allows you to discover the fundamental truth of the Spirit, often buried deep within yourself, when
                    the physical aspect takes over, because of your lifestyle. This pillar of light is akin to a diamond
                    light, an ascending crystal column that some mystics feel when their 12 chakras are aligned and form a
                    sort of column of light.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">However, every individual, having accessed this pillar of light, knows that they have an infinite source
                    of knowledge, wisdom, compassion, peace and Truth. This pillar of light not only brings incredible
                    blessing, but promotes accession to a higher level of wisdom and truth.</p>
                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">THE NUMBER 11:
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">The 11 is a leader, a personality that cannot be forgotten. It marks our life to profound degrees, in
                    areas that are specific to it. This number denotes a certain tendency towards domination, but a
                    brilliant destiny is reserved for it.

                    11 is the ultimate representation of strength, mastery and courage. He is endowed with very strong
                    inspiration and powerful intuition. This strong number must follow its path, and it is not uncommon for
                    this to take it very far. He is also endowed with a powerful force of action and destruction. He has
                    great spiritual mastery, and he will have an important social role to play in society and on other
                    higher planes.

                    The 11 is directly linked to the spiritual world, poetic impulses, gifts of clairvoyance, mediumship,
                    premonitory or prophetic visions. He can provide help and some guidance to others.

                    Through the number 11, your guardian angels reassure you by telling you that you will be able to
                    accomplish beautiful things for yourself, for your loved ones and for all your peers, because you are a
                    being of light. Have faith, and everything will fall into place easily so that you arrive at your real
                    inspirations.</p>
                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">THE NUMBER 111:
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">Thus, the number 111 is a spiritual awakening within your reach likely to allow you to approach life with
                    greater serenity. You must listen to your heart and welcome positive thoughts while chasing away
                    negative energies which could ultimately make you doubt and generate confusion or fear.

                    By filling your mind with positive thoughts, you will allow the seeds of change to germinate within you,
                    keeping you away from the influence of negative energies.</p>
                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">THE 1111: SYMBOLIZING THE DEMONSTRATION
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">This connection can result, in fact, in synchronization with the astral universe and divine wills. This
                    is how we attract blessings to ourselves, in consistency and in phase with our destiny. This is why
                    introspection, consisting of listening to one's conscience, leads to spiritual awakening and allows us
                    to remember who we really are: a divine being incarnated on Earth.</p>
                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">LE NUMBER 2:
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">The number 2 represents duality, exchange and confrontation. You therefore undoubtedly have very good
                    abilities to unite, reconcile and understand others. Your sensitivity and patience make you a very good
                    confidant and an effective mediator.
                    ​</p>
                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">THE NUMBER 22:
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">Angel number 22 means that your desires and goals are coming to fruition. The angel's message is that you
                    are on the right path to success and that your efforts will soon be rewarded. This number also
                    encourages you to have faith in yourself and to trust the process of life.</p>
                <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline text-start pt-4 pb-4">THE NUMBER 2222: Symbolizes positive transformation
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-6">If each mirror hour has something good to send you, for 10:22 p.m., it’s tenfold! This double hour is
                    nothing but happiness. It symbolizes intuitiveness, creativity, positivity and best of all: transforming
                    all of this into productivity. Because 2+2 = 4, and the number 4 is linked to the energy of the Earth.
                    For what ? Take the Earth signs in astrology, Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn. They are associated with the
                    reliability and solidity of the square, which has four corners. Yes, sometimes esotericism is also
                    geometry! But 4 + 4 = 8, the number of spirituality and intuitiveness which sticks, for example, to the
                    eighth sign of the zodiac: Scorpio. So the next time you see the time 10:22 p.m., trust yourself, your
                    instincts and your hard work. It can never hurt</p>
                <p class="fs-6 pb-4">In the esoteric universe, 3 is the manifestation of 1 through 2, that is to say the combination of the
                    forces of these two numbers. The creation of 2 by 1 is similar to speech which creates a sound and a
                    breath at the same time. The 1 and the 2 create the 3 by addition as speech (1) creates sound and breath
                    (2).

                    ​

                    THE NUMBER 3 also symbolizes the Holy Trinity:

                    ​

                    the Father (the dark and incomprehensible god),

                    the Son (the masculine, the solar and the fire)

                    the Holy Spirit (the feminine, the lunar and the water).

                    ​

                    In the esoteric interpretation, the 1, which is a whole, cannot be apprehended by man, in the same way
                    as God who is everywhere at the same time. Thus, the unknowable 1 potentially contains within it the 2
                    and the 3. The 2 and the 3 are expressed by the 1, in other words come from the 1 and are of the same
                    nature as it. 1 and 2 are therefore consubstantial.</p>
